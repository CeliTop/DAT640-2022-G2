# DAT640-2022-G2
## Group 2 - TREC 2019 passage reranking
##### Brenne Geoffrey - Paul Duffaut - CÃ©lian DEBETHUNE

Here is the group project carried out for the DAT640 subject taught at the University of Stavanger.
We chose the TREC-2019 passage reranking project and developed our project in python using Juptyter-Notebook.
We then wrote our own code to make it presentable and to show how to get our results.

The python modules used are:
- pyterrier
- pandas
- trectools

## Features

- Obtain a top 1000 passages from the MS MARCO collection (8.8 Million documents) according to a query and the BM25 algorithm
- Evaluate the performance of our baseline retrieval
